# hello-world
First GitHub repository test

I am new to GitHub and really want to expand my developer knowledge.
I have beginner experience with:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - Jquery
  - MySql
  - Windows / Linux Servers

My biggest passion is development and coding and really would love to spend the rest of my life doing it.
